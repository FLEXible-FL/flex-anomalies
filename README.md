# flex-anomalies 
flex-anomalies is a Python library dedicated to anomaly detection in machine learning. It offers a wide range of algorithms and techniques, including models based on distance, density, trees, and neural networks such as convolutional and recurrent architectures. The library also provides aggregators, anomaly score processing techniques, and pre-processing techniques for data. 

Anomaly detection involves examining data and detecting deviations or anomalies present in the data, with the goal of purifying data sets and identifying anomalies for further analysis.
